- Memoization - way to speed up performance by reducing computations. there are two ways that you can implement memoization: Implicit Caching, Decorator Functions.
When you use memoization, you want to implement .clear() method to manage your application's resources and performance. Here's why:
Memory management: It frees up resources by allowing you to manually purge the cache.
Data freshness: It ensures cached results stay accurate by removing outdated or incorrect data.
Control over cache behavior: It gives you the ability to reset the cache in response to events or conditions that affect data processing.
Testing and debugging: It allows you to operate your functions in a known state, without interference from cached data, which is important for reliable testing.
Performance optimization: It maintains cache efficiency by allowing periodic resets to manage size and lookup costs.
Memoization is useful in:
Recursive algorithms: As shown with the Fibonacci sequence, recursive functions that repeat the same calculations can benefit greatly from memoization by avoiding redundant operations.
Database queries: You can cache results from expensive database queries.
Data fetching: In web development, memoization can cache responses from API calls. This reduces network traffic and speeds up response times by serving cached data for repeated requests with the same parameters.
Data transformation: You can cache results of transformations that are costly in processing time.
Preventing component rendering: In frontend frameworks like React, memoization can prevent unnecessary re-renders of components as long as their their props stay the same.

- Declarative vs imperative programming
- Functional vs object-oriented programming
- Inheritance vs composition  
- Inheritance types- Single, Multi-level, Multiple
- composition types- object, function, class
- Functions - Factory , Generator, pure and Non-pure
- objects
- hashmap
- shallow and deep copy
- polyfills
- recursive problems - flatten object

- How Event loop works - how heap works  -> event loop handles the recursion, not the call stack
The Event Loop processes simple requests (non-blocking operations), such as I/O Polling, and returns the responses to the corresponding clients
A single thread from the Thread Pool is assigned to a single complex request. This thread is responsible for completing a particular blocking request by accessing external resources, such as computation, database, file system, etc.

Once the task is carried out completely, the response is sent to the Event Loop that sends that response back to the client.

Event loops handle asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It is the foundation of the non-blocking input/output in Node.js, making it one of the most important environmental features.
